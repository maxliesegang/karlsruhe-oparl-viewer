# GemeinderatsRadar

GemeinderatsRadar is an Astro-powered web application designed to provide insights and structured information about local council agendas, documents, and consultations. The application fetches, organizes, and displays data from sources like the OParl standard, making it more accessible to interested citizens.

## Live Demo

## About OParl

[OParl](https://oparl.org/) is an open standard for parliamentary information systems in Germany. It defines a standardized API for accessing information about local councils, their meetings, documents, and decisions, making government data more transparent and accessible.

## Purpose

This project specifically focuses on making the council data from Karlsruhe, Germany more accessible and user-friendly. It transforms the raw OParl data into an intuitive interface where citizens can easily browse, search, and understand local government activities and decisions.

## Features

- **Document Listings:** View all published council papers with details such as title, reference number, date, and type.
- **Consultations Details:** Display the agenda, organization roles, and results for consultations tied to meetings.
- **Search Functionality:** Search through available data using the integrated [`astro-pagefind`](https://github.com/astro-community/astro-pagefind) component.
- **Filter and Explore:** Easily explore council documents or even jump to the specific reference details.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for an accessible experience across all device types.

## Project Structure

The folder structure follows the Astro framework's best practices:

```plaintext
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Public assets, available at the root URL
â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable UI components (Astro and TypeScript)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/      # Layout components for templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/        # Astro pages (e.g., index, detail pages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/       # Shared code such as types, stores, and utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/       # Global styles and shared CSS
â””â”€â”€ package.json      # Node.js package dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Technologies

- **Astro Framework**: Fast and modern web development framework.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript to ensure type safety.
- **`astro-pagefind`**: Enables fast and feature-rich search on static Astro sites.
- **CSS**: Modern and flexible styling for the UI components.
