# Agent Guide — `src/components/`

Reusable UI components. Prefer extending existing components over creating new ones.

## Reuse Rules

- All new list pages should use `PaperListPage` + `SearchPanel`
- Wrap page content in `PageContainer` for consistent max-width
- Use `LegacyRedirectPage` for any `noindex` redirect route
- Use `FilterSelect` for every filter dropdown; do not build ad-hoc selects

## Contracts — Do Not Break

**Paper change history** — `PaperHistory` is collapsed and Pagefind-ignored.
Opening it loads the mirror's per-paper git history through the public GitHub
API; document text histories load separately only when that document is opened.
Current attachments seed the document list, and loaded paper revisions add old
attachments. Render fetched data only with `textContent`. Dates are archive
capture times, not proven publication/change dates. The oldest per-file commit
is an archive boundary, not the first publication: pre-sharding monolithic
history is not included. PDF comparisons use extracted text, so extraction
changes may appear as edits; different file ids have separate histories.
Keep source links and retry buttons available when GitHub requests fail or hit
the public rate limit. Do not embed archive snapshots in built HTML; the only
embedded data is `data-history-labels`, display names for the organizations,
meetings, and related papers the current record references, keyed by
body-relative path. Unresolved references render as "Sitzung 1284", never as
raw OParl URLs. Revisions without a visible change collapse into one row.

**Key point sources** — `keyPointSources` (scraper prompt `paper-de-v9`+) give
each key point a file and a verbatim quote, a page only when the extracted text
had page markers (~15% today; archive texts mostly have none). "Quelle:
<Anhang>" therefore targets the passage, not the PDF: `PaperSummary` passes the
link's `data-source-file` / `data-source-quote` to `showFilePassage()`
(`file-text-loader.ts`), which finds the `AuxiliaryFiles` card by `data-id`,
opens and loads its text, and wraps the quote in `mark.source-passage` via
`findQuoteRange()` (`quote-match.ts`, the scraper's folding of line breaks,
hyphenation and page markers). A "PDF S. N" link to `accessUrl#page=N` is added
only when the page is known. The quote is stored once per link (no tooltip
copy) because it is repeated on every summarized paper. Without JS, or when the
quote is not found, the reader lands on the attachment card.

**Related papers** — OParl parent/child links stay visible. Optional topical
recommendations from `paper-similar.json` live in the same card behind a native
"Thematisch ähnlich" disclosure, collapsed by default. Keep their upstream rank
and count, and label them as automatically selected by content. They
are not a procedural history. Missing recommendations render nothing. The whole
card stays outside Pagefind so suggested titles do not pollute the current paper.

**Unified paper discovery** — see [SEARCH.md](../../SEARCH.md). `SearchPanel`
uses `search-state.ts`, `search-index.ts`, and `search-panel-controller.ts`.
All five filters share a native collapsed disclosure; dates use optional from/to
inputs. `PaperListPage` provides contextual introductions and a pinned scope.
The old rendered archive and its controller have been removed.

Meeting filter IDs are defined in `src/shared/meeting-filter-definitions.ts`:

`meeting-filter-body-type` · `meeting-filter-organization` ·
`meeting-filter-district` · `meeting-filter-time-range` ·
`meeting-filter-month` · `meeting-filter-agenda` · `meeting-filter-protocol` ·
`meeting-filter-search` · `meeting-filter-reset`

On the meeting list, `meeting-filter-body-type` is the always-visible segmented
control. The remaining meeting filters live behind a "Filter" disclosure built
like the paper search toolbar: count badge, removable active-filter chips while
closed, and the match count. `MeetingList` groups rows under month headings
(`data-meeting-group`); the controller hides a month whose rows all fail.

Meeting names pass through `formatMeetingName` (`meeting-presentation.ts`)
wherever they are displayed — it drops the "(öffentlich/nicht öffentlich)"
suffix but keeps "(nicht öffentlich)". Rows and the detail page print the
committee only when the name does not already contain it.

Which selects are rendered depends on the list variant, declared as
`data-meeting-filters="upcoming" | "archive"` on the panel and read back by
`meeting-filter-controller.ts`:

- `upcoming` — Gremium · Ortschaft · **Zeitraum** · **Tagesordnung**
- `archive` — Gremium · Ortschaft · **Monat** · **Protokoll**

`MeetingList.astro` emits the matching card data (`data-month`,
`data-has-protocol` alongside the shared attributes); a new filter needs a value
in `buildMeetingFilterModel`, an attribute on the card, and a branch in
`matchesItem`.

**Pagefind**

- Wrap interactive list UIs with `data-pagefind-ignore`
- Preserve `data-pagefind-sort` on date metadata (`date:` in `PaperHeader`,
  `modified:` in `PaperFacts`)
- Search weights reflect the source's signal: summary prose and key points `2`,
  attachment names `1.5`, extracted PDF text `0.75`. The title already gets
  Pagefind's default heading and title-meta boosts. PDF-only terms stay searchable.
- Search results are rendered by `SearchPanel.astro` +
  `search-panel-controller.ts` against the Pagefind JS API — the
  `astro-pagefind` integration was replaced by `integrations/pagefind-lean.mjs`,
  and its `<Search>` component is intentionally not used
- Result cards read these `data-pagefind-meta` names:
  `PaperHeader` sets `paper-type` · `paper-date`;
  `PaperFacts` sets `paper-reference` · `paper-organizations` ·
  `paper-submitters` · `paper-districts` · `paper-modified` · `paper-created`
- Where the detail page displays the value, the meta rides on that element so it
  is never shown twice. Where it does not, it uses the literal `name:value` form
  on an empty span, which registers the value without adding page text or search
  excerpts — `paper-created`, plus both of `PaperHeader`'s, which have no visible
  home since the header shows only the title and status bar
- Pagefind searches metadata fields too, but metadata-only matches may lack a
  useful page-text excerpt. Keep fields readers search by in visible page text
  where practical — the "Eckdaten" card carries the reference number instead
  of leaving it only in the (Pagefind-ignored) breadcrumb
- Panel selectors and events are owned by `search-panel-controller.ts`.
- Detail pages emit categorical/date filters and a numeric `changed` rank from
  the canonical paper inventory. These carry no searchable text.

**Extracted file text — indexed at build, fetched at runtime**

`AuxiliaryFiles.astro` renders each attachment's full extracted PDF text. That
text is ~61% of all paper HTML (~276 MB), so the `pagefind-lean` integration
(`integrations/pagefind-lean.mjs`) indexes every page **as rendered** and only
then empties the container in the written file. `file-text-loader.ts` re-fetches
it from the syndication mirror when a reader opens the disclosure.

Indexing before stripping preserves search coverage; the weights above affect
ranking and excerpt choice. Do not reorder those two steps, and keep this markup:

```
<details data-file-text-details>        ← wrapper the loader binds to
  <p class="file-text" data-file-text data-file-id="10003" data-pagefind-weight="0.75">…</p>
</details>
```

- `data-file-text` is the strip marker; the integration matches the bare flag,
  so never rename it to a prefix like `data-file-text-…` on that element
- `data-file-id` is the mirror's file id — omitted when no text exists, which is
  what keeps the "Kein Text verfügbar" placeholder out of the lazy path
- An **empty** container is the signal that stripping ran. `astro dev` does not
  strip, so the text stays inlined there and nothing is fetched

**Generated sitting previews — fetched at runtime, never built in**

`MeetingDigest.astro` renders an empty, `hidden` shell; `meeting-digest-loader.ts`
fetches the preview from the mirror and reveals the section only once one
arrives. This is the opposite trade to the extracted text above: nothing is
stripped, because nothing is ever rendered. The scraper writes a preview seven
days and one day before a sitting, so a build-time copy would be missing exactly
in the window it is worth reading — and most sittings have none at all, which is
why an absent preview must leave no empty card behind.

```
<section data-meeting-digest data-meeting-id="10731"
         data-meeting-digest-leads="day,week" data-meeting-digest-past="false" hidden>
  <span data-meeting-digest-badge>      ← gets model/prompt provenance as `title`
  <p    data-meeting-digest-overview>
  <h3   data-meeting-digest-points-heading>  ← hidden together with the list
  <ul   data-meeting-digest-points>     ← one `<li>` per highlight
  <span data-meeting-digest-note>       ← generation date, uncovered agenda items
</section>
```

- `data-meeting-digest-leads` is the fetch order, best first (`day` sees the
  final agenda). An upcoming sitting always lists both lead times; a past one
  lists only what the checkout held at build time, so archive pages do not spend
  a pair of 404s on previews that will never be written
- Every fetched value is written with `textContent`. The preview is a generated
  document from another site and must never be parsed as HTML
- Any rule that sets `display` on a container the loader hides needs a matching
  `[hidden]` rule — `display` beats the `hidden` attribute

**Internal links**

- Every internal `href` must be prefixed with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` to work on GitHub Pages
- Build route URLs with the `build*Url` helpers in `utils.ts` rather than
  interpolating a path — they own the slugging and encoding each route expects
  (`buildDistrictUrl` slugifies, `buildFactionUrl` percent-encodes,
  `buildMeetingUrl` returns `undefined` for an unusable id so callers render the
  name unlinked instead of linking to a bare `/sitzungen/`)
- `PaperFacts` links each submitter and district to its own list page. Factions
  hidden by `HIDDEN_SUBMITTER_IDS` in `data.ts` have no page, so
  `resolvePaperSubmitters` omits their `factionId` and the name renders
  unlinked — do not link on name alone

**Sticky offsets**

The site header is `position: sticky`. Anything that sticks or is scrolled to
below it must clear `--site-header-height` (defined in `Layout.astro`, consumed
by `SiteNavigation.astro`) — see `.detail-side` and the `#paper-files`
deep-link target.

## Adding New Components

- Keep text and labels in German unless a broader i18n change is requested
- If the component appears on list pages, check whether it needs `data-pagefind-ignore`
