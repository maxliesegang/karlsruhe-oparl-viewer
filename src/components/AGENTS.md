# Agent Guide — `src/components/`

Reusable UI components. Prefer extending existing components over creating new ones.

## Reuse Rules

- All new list pages should use `PaperListPage` + `PaperList`
- Wrap page content in `PageContainer` for consistent max-width
- Use `LegacyRedirectPage` for any `noindex` redirect route
- Use `FilterSelect` for every filter dropdown; do not build ad-hoc selects

## Contracts — Do Not Break

**Filter control IDs** — `paper-list-controller.ts` selects controls by these exact IDs:

```
filter-year  filter-type  filter-org  filter-role  filter-result  filter-stadtteil
```

And reads data from table row `data-*` attributes that match these names.

Meeting filter IDs are defined in `src/shared/meeting-filter-definitions.ts`:

`meeting-filter-body-type` · `meeting-filter-organization` ·
`meeting-filter-district` · `meeting-filter-time-range` ·
`meeting-filter-month` · `meeting-filter-agenda` · `meeting-filter-protocol` ·
`meeting-filter-search` · `meeting-filter-reset`

On the meeting list, `meeting-filter-body-type` is the always-visible segmented
control. The remaining meeting filters live in the collapsible advanced panel.

Which selects are rendered depends on the list variant, declared as
`data-meeting-filters="upcoming" | "archive"` on the panel and read back by
`meeting-filter-controller.ts`:

- `upcoming` — Gremium · Ortschaft · **Zeitraum** · **Tagesordnung**
- `archive` — Gremium · Ortschaft · **Monat** · **Protokoll**

`MeetingList.astro` emits the matching card data (`data-month`,
`data-has-protocol` alongside the shared attributes); a new filter needs a value
in `buildMeetingFilterModel`, an attribute on the card, and a branch in
`matchesItem`.

**Pagefind**

- Wrap interactive list UIs with `data-pagefind-ignore`
- Preserve `data-pagefind-sort` on date metadata (`date:` in `PaperHeader`,
  `modified:` in `PaperFacts`)
- Search weights reflect the source's signal: summary prose and key points `2`,
  attachment names `1.5`, extracted PDF text `0.75`. The title already gets
  Pagefind's default heading and title-meta boosts. PDF-only terms stay searchable.
- Search results are rendered by `SearchPanel.astro` +
  `search-panel-controller.ts` against the Pagefind JS API — the
  `astro-pagefind` integration was replaced by `integrations/pagefind-lean.mjs`,
  and its `<Search>` component is intentionally not used
- Result cards read these `data-pagefind-meta` names:
  `PaperHeader` sets `paper-type` · `paper-date`;
  `PaperFacts` sets `paper-reference` · `paper-organizations` ·
  `paper-submitters` · `paper-districts` · `paper-modified` · `paper-created`
- Where the detail page displays the value, the meta rides on that element so it
  is never shown twice. Where it does not, it uses the literal `name:value` form
  on an empty span, which registers the value without adding page text or search
  excerpts — `paper-created`, plus both of `PaperHeader`'s, which have no visible
  home since the header shows only the title and status bar
- Pagefind searches metadata fields too, but metadata-only matches may lack a
  useful page-text excerpt. Keep fields readers search by in visible page text
  where practical — the "Eckdaten" card carries the reference number instead
  of leaving it only in the (Pagefind-ignored) breadcrumb
- Panel markup contract (selectors in `pagefind-config.ts`):
  `data-search-panel` (with `data-base-url` + `data-sort-mode`) ·
  `data-search-form` · `data-search-input` · `data-search-clear` ·
  `data-search-status` · `data-search-results` · `data-search-empty` ·
  `data-search-load-trigger`

**Extracted file text — indexed at build, fetched at runtime**

`AuxiliaryFiles.astro` renders each attachment's full extracted PDF text. That
text is ~61% of all paper HTML (~276 MB), so the `pagefind-lean` integration
(`integrations/pagefind-lean.mjs`) indexes every page **as rendered** and only
then empties the container in the written file. `file-text-loader.ts` re-fetches
it from the syndication mirror when a reader opens the disclosure.

Indexing before stripping preserves search coverage; the weights above affect
ranking and excerpt choice. Do not reorder those two steps, and keep this markup:

```
<details data-file-text-details>        ← wrapper the loader binds to
  <p class="file-text" data-file-text data-file-id="10003" data-pagefind-weight="0.75">…</p>
</details>
```

- `data-file-text` is the strip marker; the integration matches the bare flag,
  so never rename it to a prefix like `data-file-text-…` on that element
- `data-file-id` is the mirror's file id — omitted when no text exists, which is
  what keeps the "Kein Text verfügbar" placeholder out of the lazy path
- An **empty** container is the signal that stripping ran. `astro dev` does not
  strip, so the text stays inlined there and nothing is fetched

**Generated sitting previews — fetched at runtime, never built in**

`MeetingDigest.astro` renders an empty, `hidden` shell; `meeting-digest-loader.ts`
fetches the preview from the mirror and reveals the section only once one
arrives. This is the opposite trade to the extracted text above: nothing is
stripped, because nothing is ever rendered. The scraper writes a preview seven
days and one day before a sitting, so a build-time copy would be missing exactly
in the window it is worth reading — and most sittings have none at all, which is
why an absent preview must leave no empty card behind.

```
<section data-meeting-digest data-meeting-id="10731"
         data-meeting-digest-leads="day,week" data-meeting-digest-past="false" hidden>
  <span data-meeting-digest-badge>      ← gets model/prompt provenance as `title`
  <p    data-meeting-digest-overview>
  <h3   data-meeting-digest-points-heading>  ← hidden together with the list
  <ul   data-meeting-digest-points>     ← one `<li>` per highlight
  <span data-meeting-digest-note>       ← generation date, uncovered agenda items
</section>
```

- `data-meeting-digest-leads` is the fetch order, best first (`day` sees the
  final agenda). An upcoming sitting always lists both lead times; a past one
  lists only what the checkout held at build time, so archive pages do not spend
  a pair of 404s on previews that will never be written
- Every fetched value is written with `textContent`. The preview is a generated
  document from another site and must never be parsed as HTML
- Any rule that sets `display` on a container the loader hides needs a matching
  `[hidden]` rule — `display` beats the `hidden` attribute

**Internal links**

- Every internal `href` must be prefixed with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` to work on GitHub Pages
- Build route URLs with the `build*Url` helpers in `utils.ts` rather than
  interpolating a path — they own the slugging and encoding each route expects
  (`buildDistrictUrl` slugifies, `buildFactionUrl` percent-encodes,
  `buildMeetingUrl` returns `undefined` for an unusable id so callers render the
  name unlinked instead of linking to a bare `/sitzungen/`)
- `PaperFacts` links each submitter and district to its own list page. Factions
  hidden by `HIDDEN_SUBMITTER_IDS` in `data.ts` have no page, so
  `resolvePaperSubmitters` omits their `factionId` and the name renders
  unlinked — do not link on name alone

**Sticky offsets**

The site header is `position: sticky`. Anything that sticks or is scrolled to
below it must clear `--site-header-height` (defined in `Layout.astro`, consumed
by `SiteNavigation.astro`) — see `.detail-side` and the `#paper-files`
deep-link target.

## Adding New Components

- Keep text and labels in German unless a broader i18n change is requested
- If the component appears on list pages, check whether it needs `data-pagefind-ignore`
